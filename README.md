# stock_project
portfolio project that pulls stock data to a seperate sheet

Using this project to expand my knowledge in python with exporting data to an excel workbook that is seperated in sheets
which are devoted to individual Tickers

Stocks.py is basically the model i am using to change stock.py into the fully functioning script.

This API is a free key from alpha_vantage
